			<h2 class="quoted-text"> I want to start a startup, but I don't know how to program. How long will it take to learn?</h2>
			<p class="quoted-text"> I would guess a smart person can learn to hack sufficiently well in 6 months to a year. The best way to do it would be to find some startup to hire you in an initially menial capacity, and start learning to program on the side. Then gradually work your way up from answering phones through system administration to actual software design. There is always so much to do in a startup that people won't be too picky about your paper qualifications, if you can solve problems for them without screwing up.  </p>
